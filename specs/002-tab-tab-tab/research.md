# Research Findings: JIRA Tab Management System

## Testing Framework for React 19 + TypeScript PWA

**Decision**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright for E2E  
**Rationale**: 
- Vitest: Native TypeScript support, excellent React 19 compatibility, fast execution
- React Testing Library: Component testing focused on user behavior
- Playwright: PWA-specific testing capabilities for offline scenarios

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Slower setup, requires additional TypeScript configuration
- Cypress: Less PWA-friendly than Playwright

## State Migration Strategy for Zustand

**Decision**: Versioned state with migration functions in persist middleware  
**Rationale**:
- Zustand persist provides built-in migration support via `migrate` option
- Version-based approach allows gradual rollout of tab features
- Backward compatibility for users without tabs

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual localStorage detection: More complex error handling
- Complete state reset: Poor user experience

## Tab Switching Performance Optimization

**Decision**: React.memo for tab content + lazy loading for inactive tabs  
**Rationale**:
- React 19's automatic optimizations handle most cases
- Tab content components only re-render when their specific data changes
- Inactive tab content can be lazily loaded to reduce initial bundle

**Alternatives considered**:
- Virtual scrolling: Overkill for max 10 tabs
- Complete re-mounting: Loses form state

## localStorage Management for Multi-tab State

**Decision**: Single localStorage key with structured tab data + size monitoring  
**Rationale**:
- Zustand persist handles serialization automatically
- Single key reduces localStorage fragmentation
- Built-in size monitoring prevents quota issues

**Alternatives considered**:
- One key per tab: More complex cleanup logic
- IndexedDB: Unnecessary complexity for simple tab data

## React Error Boundary Patterns

**Decision**: Tab-level error boundaries with fallback UI  
**Rationale**:
- Individual tab failures don't crash entire application
- Users can recover by closing/reopening affected tabs
- Error reporting maintains application stability

**Alternatives considered**:
- Global error boundary: Poor isolation
- No error boundaries: Poor user experience on errors

## PWA-Specific Considerations

**Decision**: Service worker cache for tab state backup + offline tab creation  
**Rationale**:
- Tab state persists even if localStorage fails
- Users can create new tabs while offline
- Consistent experience across network conditions

**Alternatives considered**:
- Online-only: Breaks PWA experience
- Complex sync logic: Unnecessary for single-user application
